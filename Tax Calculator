This is a C program that simulates a tax calculator for employees. The program allows the user to enter the details of an employee such as name, basic salary, house allowance, medical allowance, commuter allowance, and marital status. It then calculates the gross pay, taxable income, tax and net pay for the employee.
The program also allows the user to view the details of an individual employee or all employees' details that have been entered into the system. The user can also enter a new employee's details or exit the program.
